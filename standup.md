Yifeng,
 
Thanks for this feedback. Your input is timely, as we're in the process of reworking the allocations portal overall. We'll include your feedback as we work through the changes.

Ken, Dave and Stephen,
I'm reviewing an Accelerate ACCESS proposal, in which a postdoc asked 3M ACCESS Credits. The proposal provided code performance chart without mentioning which system was based and how coming up with the Credits estimate, I then looked at the updated ACCESS online policies in a few details (https://allocations.access-ci.org/), realizing that the policies didn't specifically require those information for Accelerate proposals, I'd like to share my two comments below in this regard:
1.	ACCESS Credits. Appears to be the very central in this new ACCESS allocation, but there is nowhere mentioned how ACCESS Credit are technically defined. Looking at exchange calculator, 1 ACCESS credit is equal to 1 common cpu system core-hr, with exceptions, one can figure out this, but if PIs don't do the homework for "calculator" study, or they get used with node-hrs or GPU-hrs, they could propose wrong units, we repeated seeing this kind of confusion even with maximize proposals. Thought a brief text description would be helpful defining what it means an ACCESSE Credit, ideally list one system as basis (we did so before with XRAC) how 1 credit is defined, e.g. PSC Bridges-2 regular memory 1 CPU core-hr.
1.	Estimates of resources. For first three tiers, no scaling is required which is fine. The policy askes estimate of resources "how much computing support will this effort approximately require in terms of core, node or GPU-hrs?",  without requiring the information how to convert to the requested Credits, which is needed for review evaluation. Would be helpful to connect Credits to estimates of resource somehow as a requirement.
1.	Accelerate proposal example. One example is online at
https://allocations.access-ci.org/example-proposals/Accelerate.pdf, which requested node-hrs on Summit. This is neither an Accelerate proposal, nor with an ACCESS system, yet with node-hr here which is confusing as our Credits are core-hrs based.
